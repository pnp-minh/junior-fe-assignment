## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Fork the Repository

- Go to: https://github.com/pnp-minh/junior-fe-assignment
- Click the **Fork** button (top right)
- This creates a copy under your GitHub account

### 2. Clone Your Fork

```bash

cd junior-fe-assignment
```

Replace `YOUR-USERNAME` with your GitHub username.

### 3. Create Your Branch

Use your name for the branch (lowercase, hyphenated):

```bash
git checkout -b firstname-lastname

# Examples:
# git checkout -b john-doe
# git checkout -b jane-smith
```

**Important**: Make sure you're on your branch before starting work!

```bash
# Verify your branch
git branch
# Should show: * firstname-lastname
```

### 4. Complete the Assignment

#### Part 1: Algorithms (30-45 min)

```bash
cd part-1-algorithms
# Read README.md
# Complete question-1.js
# Complete question-2.js
# Test: node question-1.js && node question-2.js
```

#### Part 2: React Component (1.5-2 hours)

```bash
cd part-2-react
# Read README.md
npm install
# Implement component based on Figma design
npm run dev  # Test locally
npm run build  # Verify build works
```

### 5. Commit Your Work

Make meaningful commits as you progress:

```bash
# After completing Part 1
git add part-1-algorithms/
git commit -m "Complete Part 1: Implement array reversal and character frequency counter"

# After starting Part 2
git add part-2-react/
git commit -m "Start Part 2: Create component structure"

# After implementing components
git add part-2-react/
git commit -m "Implement main component based on Figma design"

git add part-2-react/
git commit -m "Add responsive styling for mobile and desktop"

git add part-2-react/
git commit -m "Final polish and code cleanup"
```

**Good commit practices**:

- ‚úÖ Commit frequently (not just one big commit)
- ‚úÖ Use clear, descriptive messages
- ‚úÖ Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- ‚ùå Don't commit node_modules or build files (already in .gitignore)

### 6. Push to Your Fork

# Push your branch to your forked repository
git push origin firstname-lastname
```

If this is your first push, Git will ask you to set upstream:

```bash
git push --set-upstream origin firstname-lastname
