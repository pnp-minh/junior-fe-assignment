Welcome! This assignment is designed to assess your skills in JavaScript fundamentals and React development. The entire assignment should take approximately 2-3 hours to complete.

## Overview

This assignment consists of two parts:

1. **Part 1: Data Structures & Algorithms** (~30-45 minutes)
2. **Part 2: React Component Implementation** (~1.5-2 hours)

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Git
- Code editor (VS Code recommended)

## Getting Started

1. **Fork this repository**:

   - Click the **Fork** button at the top right of this page
   - This creates a copy under your GitHub account

2. **Clone your fork**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/junior-fe-assignment.git
   cd junior-fe-assignment
   ```

3. **Create your own branch** (use your name):

   ```bash
   git checkout -b firstname-lastname
   # Example: git checkout -b john-doe
   ```

4. **Complete both parts** of the assignment (see folders below)

5. **Commit your work** with clear, meaningful messages:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Complete Part 1: Array reversal and character frequency"
   git commit -m "Complete Part 2: Component implementation"
   ```

6. **Push to your fork**:

   ```bash
   git push origin firstname-lastname
   ```

7. **Create a Pull Request**:

   - Go to your fork on GitHub
   - Click **"Pull Request"** → **"New Pull Request"**
   - Select your branch (`firstname-lastname`)
   - Click **"Create Pull Request"**
   - Add any notes or comments in the description

8. **You're done!** We'll review your pull request.

## Time Limit

You have **2-3 hours** to complete both parts. We value quality over speed, so focus on writing clean, well-structured code.
