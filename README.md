Welcome! This assignment is designed to assess your skills in JavaScript fundamentals and React development. The entire assignment should take approximately 2-3 hours to complete.

## Overview

This assignment consists of two parts:

1. **Part 1: Data Structures & Algorithms** (~30-45 minutes)
2. **Part 2: React Component Implementation** (~1.5-2 hours)

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Git
- Code editor (VS Code recommended)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone this repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pnp-minh/junior-fe-assignment.git
   cd junior-fe-assignment
   ```

2. **Create your own branch** (use your name):

   ```bash
   git checkout -b firstname-lastname
   # Example: git checkout -b john-doe
   ```

3. **Complete both parts** of the assignment (see folders below)

4. **Commit your work** with clear, meaningful messages:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Complete Part 1: Array reversal and character frequency"
   git commit -m "Complete Part 2: Component implementation"
   ```

5. **Push your branch** to the repository:

   ```bash
   git push origin firstname-lastname
   ```

6. **You're done!** We'll review your branch directly. No pull request needed.

## Time Limit

You have **2-3 hours** to complete both parts. We value quality over speed, so focus on writing clean, well-structured code.

## Evaluation Criteria

Your submission will be evaluated based on:

- **Code Quality**: Clean, readable, and maintainable code
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: Proper code structure (TypeScript is a bonus!)
- **Problem Solving**: Logical approach to solving the problems
- **Best Practices**: Following React and JavaScript best practices
- **Attention to Detail**: UI implementation matching the design
- **Error Handling**: Proper error handling and edge cases
- **Git Usage**: Clear commit messages and logical commit history
